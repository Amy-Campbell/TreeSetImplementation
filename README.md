# TreeSetImplementation
This is Group 2's final project for CMPT 231: Data Structures and Algorithms. This project contains an implementation for a set collection using an AVL tree as the underlying structure to store the elements.

## Usage
The TreeSet class contains all of the methods for set implementation. Custom objects can be stored in the set provided they implement the compareTo() method.
